**Scenario:**
A Flink job consumes from Kafka and writes to a sink. The consumer lag has been growing steadily over the last 4 hours. By the time you check, it is 90 minutes behind. The on-call engineer wants to scale the job up immediately.

In the interview, the question is:

> A streaming job's consumer lag keeps growing. Walk through the questions you would ask before touching any code.

This is testing whether you can resist the "scale it up" reflex and find the real cause.

---

### Your Task:

1. List the questions you would ask first.
2. Explain how to read the lag pattern.
3. Cover the most common causes.
4. Decide when scaling is right and when it is the wrong move.

---

### What a Good Answer Covers:

* Is throughput slower than the source rate?
* Is the source rate suddenly higher than usual?
* Is the sink slow (back-pressure)?
* Hot key / skew.
* Resource constraints inside the job.
* When scaling helps; when it just hides the problem.

## Solution 58: Streaming Consumer Lag Diagnosis

### Short version you can say out loud

> Before scaling, I would answer four questions: is the source producing more than usual, is the sink slower than usual, is the processing stage itself stuck on a hot key, and is there a resource limit inside the job. Each of those has a different fix. Scaling the job up helps for one of them and is wasted on the rest.

### The four questions

```
1. Is the source rate higher than normal?      (input side)
2. Is the sink slower than normal?              (output side, back-pressure)
3. Is the job's processing logic stuck somewhere?  (skew, hot key)
4. Is the job hitting a resource limit?         (CPU, memory, network)
```

I check them in this order because each has a cheaper fix than the next.

### Question 1: source rate

Look at the producer-side metrics. Is the topic's input rate higher than usual?

```
Producer rate, last 6 hours
─────────────────────────────
typical : 5,000 msgs/sec
now     : 28,000 msgs/sec
```

If yes: the source is producing faster than usual. Probably a marketing campaign, a scheduled batch dump, a new feature went live. The job is doing what it should — it just cannot keep up with the new rate.

**The fix is scaling.** This is the case where the senior engineer's "scale up" is right. But understand the why, because tomorrow you might need to scale back down.

### Question 2: sink rate (back-pressure)

Look at the sink. If the job writes to a database, is the database saturated? If it writes to another Kafka topic, is the downstream consumer keeping up?

Flink's UI shows back-pressure per operator. A red "high back-pressure" on the sink operator means the sink is the bottleneck. The job is processing fast but cannot push fast enough.

If yes: scaling the job up does nothing. The sink can't take more. Fixes:

* Scale the sink (more database connections, bigger instance, partition the write).
* Batch sink writes (fewer larger inserts instead of many small ones).
* Asynchronous sink with proper back-pressure (Flink has an async I/O operator).

### Question 3: a stuck stage (hot key or skew)

Flink's UI shows per-task metrics. If one task is 100% busy and the others are idle, you have skew.

```
Operator: keyed aggregation
  Task 0:  100% busy  (processing user_id="superuser")
  Task 1:  10% busy
  Task 2:  9% busy
  Task 3:  11% busy
```

One key is dominating. The job cannot scale by adding workers because the work is bottlenecked on one slot.

Fixes:

* Identify the hot key and decide how to handle it (rate-limit, route to a dedicated stream).
* Use Flink's `salt` pattern: append a random suffix to the key, aggregate in two phases.
* Some processors handle this automatically (Spark Structured Streaming with AQE).

### Question 4: resource limits

Look at the cluster metrics for the job:

* CPU at 100% across all workers? Genuinely compute-bound. Scale up.
* Memory pressure with GC pauses? Increase memory or reduce state size.
* Network saturated? Probably reading large messages; consider compression.

These call for scaling, but the scaling target depends on the constraint. Adding workers does not help if memory per worker is the issue.

### Reading the lag pattern

The shape of the lag over time tells you which case it is:

* **Lag has been steady, then started growing 4 hours ago.** Something changed at that point. Look at deploys, source-side changes, sink changes. Question 1, 2, or 4.
* **Lag is growing at a constant rate.** The job's processing rate is just below the source rate. Scale up.
* **Lag growth is bursty.** Source has spikes the job can't smooth. Either scale to peak, or accept some lag.
* **Lag is huge on one partition only.** That partition is hot or its keys are skewed. Question 3.

### A diagnostic walkthrough

The scenario: lag is 90 minutes after 4 hours of growth. Steps:

1. Source rate: check producer dashboard. Up 3x for the last 4 hours. Found: a vendor restarted and is replaying their buffered data.
2. Sink rate: nominal.
3. Skew: none.
4. Cluster: CPU at 65%, headroom available.

Conclusion: the source is dumping a replay. The job has room to scale but is not maxed. The lag will recover once the replay finishes. Two options:

* Scale the job up temporarily to catch up faster.
* Do nothing; the lag will recover naturally in ~6 hours.

Either is correct. Picking depends on whether downstream consumers can tolerate 90-min lag for that long.

### When scaling is the right call

* The source rate has genuinely increased and will stay there.
* The job is CPU- or network-bound and has headroom on the cluster.
* You need to drain a backlog quickly, even if it is temporary.

### When scaling is the wrong call

* Sink is the bottleneck. Scaling the job adds back-pressure without throughput.
* Hot-key skew. Adding workers does nothing for the slot that is overloaded.
* Memory-bound. More workers with the same per-worker memory hits the same wall.

The danger of scaling first: it sometimes masks the real problem long enough for it to compound later.

### Tools

* **Kafka lag metric**: `consumer_group_lag` for the most direct signal.
* **Flink UI**: per-operator back-pressure indicator, per-task busy-time, watermark progress.
* **Cluster metrics**: CPU, memory, network on each worker.
* **Source-side metrics**: producer rate, message size, errors.

### What I would also do besides scaling

* **Alerts on lag.** Page when lag exceeds N minutes for M minutes. This incident should have woken someone at the 15-minute mark.
* **Capacity planning.** Know the maximum throughput of the job in messages/sec. Compare against expected peak.
* **Replay protocol.** When a vendor replays, the consumer side often experiences exactly this. Have a "scale to 2x during expected replays" runbook.

### Common mistakes interviewers want you to name

1. **Scale before diagnosing.** Wastes money and hides the real cause.
2. **Trust "the job looks fine."** The Flink UI's back-pressure indicator is your friend.
3. **No alerting on lag.** Always discovered too late.
4. **Confusing source spike with sink slowdown.** Different fixes.
5. **Forgetting hot keys.** A single skewed key undoes any scaling.

### Bonus follow-up the interviewer might throw

> *"What if scaling does fix it for a few hours, then the lag grows again?"*

That is a sign of a hidden steady-state problem: the source rate is creeping up, or the job's per-message work is growing (state size growing, garbage collection getting worse). Don't keep scaling. Profile the job:

* State size growing unbounded? Add TTL or smaller state.
* CPU time per message growing? A library update introduced overhead.
* Network or sink saturated at higher scale?

Scale gives you breathing room. The fix to a creeping problem is upstream of scaling.

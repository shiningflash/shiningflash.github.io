**Scenario:**
You are designing the data model for an app like Airbnb. Hosts list properties. Guests search, book, pay and review. There are calendars, prices that change by date, cancellations, refunds, and multiple guests per booking. The interviewer wants to see you reason about which tables exist, what is a fact and what is a dimension, and where the trade-offs hide.

In the interview, the question is:

> Walk me through how you would design tables for an app like Airbnb. Start from the obvious entities and tell me where the trade offs hide.

---

### Your Task:

1. List the entities and their grain.
2. Draw the relationships.
3. Cover the trade-offs around bookings, prices and reviews.
4. Mention the warehouse layer on top.

---

### What a Good Answer Covers:

* Users, listings, calendars, bookings, payments, reviews.
* OLTP shape vs warehouse star schema.
* Pricing as a separate, time-varying table.
* Booking as the central fact.
* Slowly changing dimensions (listing details, host details).

## Solution 41: Tables for an Airbnb Like App

### Short version you can say out loud

> Two layers. The OLTP layer is normalized: one row per real-world thing, foreign keys between them. The warehouse layer is a star schema: bookings are the main fact, and users, listings, dates and locations are dimensions. The trade-offs all show up around things that change over time: prices, listing descriptions, host status. Those need a date dimension or an SCD2 history table so historical reports stay correct.

### Entities in the OLTP layer

```
users
─────────────────────────────────
user_id (PK)
email, name, joined_at, country
is_host (bool)

listings
─────────────────────────────────
listing_id (PK)
host_id (FK → users.user_id)
title, description, city, country, lat, lng
property_type, max_guests, num_bedrooms
created_at

listing_amenities       (one row per amenity per listing)
─────────────────────────────────
listing_id, amenity        (composite PK)

calendar
─────────────────────────────────
listing_id, date           (composite PK)
is_available (bool)
nightly_price (cents)
minimum_stay
updated_at

bookings
─────────────────────────────────
booking_id (PK)
listing_id (FK)
guest_id   (FK)
checkin_date, checkout_date
num_guests
total_price_cents
status   (requested, confirmed, cancelled, completed)
created_at, cancelled_at

payments
─────────────────────────────────
payment_id (PK)
booking_id (FK)
amount_cents, currency
type (charge, refund, payout)
status (pending, succeeded, failed)
created_at

reviews
─────────────────────────────────
review_id (PK)
booking_id (FK)
reviewer_id, reviewee_id
rating, body
created_at
```

Notice three things:

1. **The calendar is one row per (listing, date).** Each night has its own price and availability. This is the "varies over time" pattern.
2. **A booking can have multiple payments.** One charge, one refund, one host payout. So `payments` is a child of `bookings`, not 1:1.
3. **Reviews go both ways.** Guest reviews host, host reviews guest. One booking can produce two reviews.

### Why the calendar is separate

The first instinct is to put `price` and `available` on `listings`. That breaks the moment a host wants different prices on different nights. So the calendar is its own table, grain = (listing, date). This is the most common modeling decision around Airbnb-like apps. Get this wrong and pricing reports lie forever.

The price the guest pays is **frozen at booking time** into `bookings.total_price_cents`. If the host changes the price later, old bookings keep their original total. The calendar is "what is for sale today," not "history of prices charged."

If you also need a price history (e.g., to analyze price changes), keep a `calendar_history` table or use SCD2 on `calendar`.

```

* `fact_booking` is the grain "one row per booking." This is the most queried table.
* `dim_listing` is SCD2: when a listing's title or property type changes, the old version is kept so old reports show the listing as it was.
* `dim_user` is one table for both hosts and guests. A single user can be both. The `is_host` flag is a label, not a separate entity.
* `dim_date` is the conventional date dimension with year, quarter, month, day-of-week, is-holiday, etc.
* `fact_payment` is at the grain "one row per payment event." Cancellations and refunds are negative entries.
* `fact_review` is at the grain "one row per review."

### Trade-offs

**1. Is a cancelled booking still a row in fact_booking?**

Yes. It is a booking that existed. The `status` field tells you it was cancelled. If you remove it, queries like "how many cancellations this month" stop working. Aggregations on `status = 'completed'` filter out the cancellations naturally.

**2. Should the warehouse store the calendar or just the booking?**

Both. The booking is what happened. The calendar is what was offered. Analysts want both: "what was the average listed price last summer" needs the calendar; "what was the average paid price last summer" needs the booking.

I would model `fact_calendar_day` at grain (listing, date) with `is_available`, `nightly_price`. It is large but extremely useful for pricing analytics.

**3. Multi-currency.**

`bookings.total_price_cents` is in the guest's local currency. To compare across countries, you need conversion. Two options:

* Store `total_usd_cents` too, computed at booking time using that day's FX rate.
* Store an `fx_rates` daily table and join when reporting.

The first is simpler for reporting; the second is more accurate over long histories. I would do both: freeze the USD value at booking time for fast queries, and keep the FX rate for audit.

**4. Reviews from both directions.**

Two reviews per booking (guest of host, host of guest) are different rows in `fact_review`. The `direction` column distinguishes them. Average ratings differ by direction; treat them separately.

### Where the SCD2 hides

Three places change over time and need SCD2:

* **Listings.** Hosts edit the title, photos, even the property type. Old bookings should still show the listing as the guest saw it at booking time.
* **Listing prices.** The calendar already gives a per-date price, so SCD2 is less critical here. But the price the host *had set* before the guest booked is sometimes useful.
* **Users (hosts).** Verified status, business account status changes. Reports about "verified hosts" should know whether the host was verified at the time of the booking, not now.

### What an analyst query looks like

```sql
-- Average revenue per night by city, last quarter
SELECT
  l.city,
  SUM(b.total_price_cents) / SUM(b.nights) / 100.0 AS revenue_per_night
FROM fact_booking b
JOIN dim_listing l
  ON l.listing_key = b.listing_key
JOIN dim_date d
  ON d.date_key = b.checkin_date_key
WHERE d.date >= '2025-01-01'
  AND d.date <  '2025-04-01'
  AND b.status IN ('completed')
GROUP BY l.city
ORDER BY revenue_per_night DESC;
```

The dimensions (`dim_listing`, `dim_date`) provide the filter and grouping columns. The fact (`fact_booking`) provides the measurement.

### Patterns I would not regret

* **One booking, one row.** Never split a single booking across many rows in the booking fact.
* **Surrogate keys.** Every dim has an integer surrogate. SCD2 versions use different surrogates for the same natural id.
* **Always keep a `created_at` and an `updated_at`.** Backfills depend on these.
* **Soft delete.** Bookings are never hard-deleted. They go to `cancelled` status.

### Common mistakes interviewers want you to name

1. **Price as a column on `listings`.** Breaks the moment per-date pricing arrives.
2. **Storing `total_price` as a float.** Use integer cents. Always.
3. **Mixing facts and dimensions** (Problem 43).
4. **Forgetting reviews can be both ways.**
5. **Not using SCD2 on `listings` when title or category changes.**
6. **No FX rate snapshot.** Multi-currency analytics drift over years.

### Bonus follow-up the interviewer might throw

> *"How would you redesign this if Airbnb added 'experiences' (tours and activities) alongside stays?"*

Two paths:

1. **Same fact table, polymorphic.** Add `booking_type` (stay vs experience) and an `experience_key` next to `listing_key`. Half the columns will be null for the other type. Simple but messy.
2. **Separate fact tables.** `fact_stay_booking` and `fact_experience_booking`, each with its own dimensions. Cleaner per use case but harder for "total revenue across all booking types" queries.

I would go with the separate-fact path and create a `fact_booking_unified` view that UNIONs them with shared columns for the cross-type queries. Best of both.

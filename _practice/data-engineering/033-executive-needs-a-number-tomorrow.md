**Scenario:**
The CFO calls at 4 PM. They are preparing a board update for tomorrow morning. They need "total customer acquisition cost by channel for the last quarter." You know the data has quality issues: there were ingestion gaps in marketing data last month, and the cost attribution model has a known disagreement with finance. You have a few hours. They want a number.

In the interview, the question is:

> An executive asks for a number by tomorrow morning, but the data has known quality issues. What do you tell them, and what do you ship?

---

### Your Task:

1. Frame the conversation with the exec.
2. Decide what to ship.
3. Cover what notes go with the number.
4. Plan the follow-up after the meeting.

---

### What a Good Answer Covers:

* You ship a number. "We don't have data" is not an answer.
* You make the caveats clear and short.
* You decide what to caveat and what to silently fix.
* You document the source so it can be reproduced.
* You ask one question to scope the answer.

## Solution 33: Executive Needs a Number Tomorrow

### Short version you can say out loud

> Executives in a time crunch need a defensible number plus the smallest possible set of caveats. I always ship a number. I never ship a wall of disclaimers. I ask one quick question to make sure I am answering the right one, I run the cleanest version of the analysis I can in the time I have, and I deliver the number with two or three sentences of context. After the meeting, I follow up with a clean rebuild and tell them if it changes.

### The conversation, before any SQL

When the CFO calls, the first move is to scope the question, not to start coding.

> "Quick clarification before I run this. By 'CAC by channel,' do you want it gross (all marketing spend per acquired customer) or net of partner reimbursements? And by 'last quarter,' Jan-Mar or your fiscal Q1?"

Two questions, one minute. Saves an hour later.

I would also ask the level of confidence they need:

> "I can give you a directional number by 7 PM that is good to ±5 percent, or a higher-confidence number tomorrow at noon. Which one do you need?"

Most of the time, "directional tonight" is the answer. The exec needs a number to talk to the board, not to file with the SEC.

### What I ship

I ship one number per channel, plus a comparison metric they will want next.

```
Channel        CAC last quarter   vs last year
─────────────────────────────────────────────
Paid Search          $42                +12%
Social               $61                +18%
Affiliate            $28                -4%
Referral             $9                 +2%
Organic              $3                 -1%
                  ─────────
Blended              $34                +9%
```

The "vs last year" is unsolicited but always asked next. Saves the second round.

### The caveats, kept short

I write a separate short note alongside the number. Two or three bullets. No more.

> Method: total spend in channel / new customers attributed to that channel, last-touch model. Source: marketing.spend_daily and analytics.customer_acquisition.
>
> Two things to know:
>
> 1. April had a 3-day gap in social ad spend ingestion. I have filled it using the daily run rate average. Impact is probably ±$2 on the social CAC. The underlying issue is being addressed.
> 2. Finance attributes a few large referral bonuses on a different basis. The number above is the analytics-team view; finance's version of "referral CAC" is ~$11. We are aligning the methodology next week.

The principle: enough caveats that the CFO does not get blindsided when finance pushes back, not so many that the number looks unreliable.

### What I would NOT do

* **Refuse to give a number.** "The data is messy" is true and useless to a CFO at 4 PM.
* **Bury caveats inside the analysis.** They never get read.
* **Make up a clean methodology I have not used before.** No surprises today. Use the existing model, flag where it disagrees with finance.
* **Send the SQL and let them figure it out.** Send a number with one clean table.
* **Promise a more precise number than I can deliver.** A wrong number tomorrow is worse than an honest one tonight.

### How I think about "the data is wrong"

Two categories of data quality issues:

* **Quantitative.** Missing rows, broken ingestion, late data. Often fixable with simple imputation or backfill. I disclose the imputation but I still ship.
* **Methodological.** Different teams compute the same metric differently. Last-touch vs multi-touch attribution. Net vs gross spend. I cannot fix this in an evening. I disclose the methodology I used, name the alternative, and offer to align it next week.

Both get a one-line caveat. Neither stops me from shipping.

### The follow-up after the meeting

The next morning, after the board update is over, two things happen:

1. **I clean up the analysis** properly. Rerun against the corrected data, document the methodology, write it up.
2. **I tell the CFO if anything changed.** "Yesterday's number was $42 for paid search. After the proper backfill, it is $41.20. The story is the same." This builds trust for the next time.

Equally important, I file a ticket for the longer-term fix on the data quality issue. The April ingestion gap probably has a root cause; we should find it.

### What if the data really cannot give a defensible answer

Sometimes the gap is too large. The honest move is to say so, but constructively.

> "I cannot give you a CAC by channel with confidence tonight because the April spend ingestion has a 14-day gap. I can give you:
>
> - CAC by channel for the previous quarter, which is clean.
> - A blended CAC for the current quarter, which I am confident in (channels aside, the totals are right).
>
> Which would be more useful for the board?"

This is still shipping a number, just a different one. It also surfaces the underlying issue without sounding like an excuse.

### The conversation if finance challenges the number

In the meeting, finance may say "our CAC for referrals is $11, not $28." Two outcomes:

1. **They are using the same data with a different methodology.** Both are defensible. The next slide should reconcile.
2. **One of us is on broken data.** Probably the team that has not reconciled in a while. We compare.

Either way, the conversation is calmer because I already flagged this in the caveats. The CFO is not surprised.

### Common mistakes interviewers want you to name

1. **Sending raw SQL or notebooks to an exec.** They will not read it.
2. **Wall of disclaimers.** Makes the number look untrustworthy.
3. **Refusing to provide a number.** Looks like obstruction to the business.
4. **Overpromising precision.** "$41.78 paid-search CAC" implies a precision the data does not have.
5. **No follow-up.** The exec uses the number forever; you never came back to check.

### Bonus follow-up the interviewer might throw

> *"What if the CFO uses the number in a board document and then a more accurate number turns out to be different?"*

I would tell them as soon as I know, not let them find out from someone else. The script:

> "Quick correction: the CAC number I sent you Tuesday was $42 for paid search. The cleaner rebuild this morning gives $39. The change is within the ±5% I quoted, and the channel rankings are unchanged. If anyone asks, the numbers are now in [link]."

Owning the change builds credibility. Hoping nobody notices destroys it.

**Scenario:**
A SQL query that the team has run daily for a year used to finish in 30 seconds. Today, on identical-looking data and the same warehouse, it takes 40 minutes. Nothing about the query has changed. Nothing about the destination has changed. Someone wants to "throw more compute at it."

In the interview, the question is:

> A query that used to run in 30 seconds last week takes 40 minutes today. How do you find out what changed?

---

### Your Task:

1. Resist "add more compute."
2. Walk through the diagnostic order.
3. Cover the most common causes when the query itself hasn't changed.
4. Mention the prevention layer.

---

### What a Good Answer Covers:

* EXPLAIN / query plan comparison.
* Data volume changes.
* Statistics drift.
* A join's broadcast vs hash flip due to size growth.
* Storage layout (partitioning, clustering, fragmentation).
* Concurrent workloads on the same warehouse.

## Solution 48: Query Suddenly 80x Slower

### Short version you can say out loud

> First thing I do is compare the query plan today against the plan from when it was fast. Most of these incidents have the same shape: a join changed strategy because one side crossed a size threshold. The query did not change, but the data did, and the optimizer made a different choice. The cure is almost never "more compute." It is finding which join flipped and helping the optimizer pick the right plan, often by updating statistics or adding a small hint.

### The diagnostic order

**1. Get the plan from today.**

```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE <the slow query>;
```

**2. Get the plan from when it was fast.**

* If the team uses an APM tool that records plans, retrieve last week's.
* In BigQuery, you can find the past job and inspect its execution.
* In Snowflake, query_history retains plans for some time.
* Otherwise, try to reconstruct: run the same query on a snapshot of last week's data if you have one.

**3. Diff the two plans.**

Look for:

* Join type changed (Hash → Nested Loop, or broadcast → hash).
* Scan changed from index/cluster prune to full scan.
* Sort that now spills to disk (writes to temporary storage).
* Estimated rows vs actual rows now wildly off.

The diff almost always tells you the bug in two minutes.

### The classic causes when the query didn't change

**1. A join flipped from broadcast to hash because the small side grew.**

A query that used to broadcast a "small dimension" of 10 MB now broadcasts 5 GB because the dimension grew. The optimizer either picks a slow plan or runs out of memory. Fix: either cap the broadcast size, force a hash join, or shrink the dimension.

**2. Statistics are stale.**

The table grew 10x but `ANALYZE` was never re-run. The optimizer thinks the table has 100k rows, picks a nested loop because "the other side is huge anyway," and the nested loop runs over 10M rows.

Fix:

```sql
-- Postgres
ANALYZE my_table;

-- BigQuery / Snowflake usually keep stats current automatically, but
-- if a CTAS just created the table, stats may not be present yet.
```

**3. A new column or change made a filter unselective.**

A `WHERE status = 'active'` used to match 5% of rows. After a backfill, 95% of rows are 'active'. The plan optimizer's choices invert: what was a good index is now bad.

Fix: either change the query, add a better partition / cluster, or use a different filter.

**4. Storage layout changed.**

In BigQuery: someone deleted and reinserted the partition with a different cluster ordering. In Postgres: heavy churn caused table bloat. In Snowflake: clustering depth got bad and the table needs reclustering.

Fix: rebuild the table or trigger reclustering.

**5. Resource contention from a noisy neighbor.**

Another team launched a daily 6 PM job that uses the same warehouse. Your 6 PM query now waits for slots.

Fix: separate warehouses or schedule shift.

**6. A new index or constraint slowed writes** (and the query happens to involve a temp table with an unexpected lock).

This is the OLTP version. Less common in warehouses.

### A real diagnostic walkthrough

Yesterday's plan:

```
HashJoin
  ├ HashAggregate over fact (returns ~10k rows)
  └ SeqScan over dim_region (5 rows)
```

Today's plan:

```
NestedLoop
  ├ SeqScan over fact (returns ~10M rows)
  └ IndexScan over dim_region
```

The reading: `dim_region` did not change, but `fact` did. The optimizer thinks `fact` is small now (statistics are stale) and picked a nested loop. Each `fact` row triggers a lookup in `dim_region`. With 10M rows in fact, that is 10M index lookups.

Fix: `ANALYZE fact`. The optimizer now sees the real row count and re-picks the hash join. Query goes back to 30 seconds.

### What I would NOT do first

* **Throw more compute at it.** Sometimes works, but you do not learn anything, and the problem grows back.
* **Rewrite the query.** Not yet. The query was fine last week.
* **Restart the warehouse.** Cargo-cult fix; rarely solves anything but feels productive.

### Other things to check quickly

* **Did the underlying tables grow a lot?** 10x growth often crosses an optimizer threshold.
* **Was there a schema change overnight?** Adding a column can change row width and storage.
* **Are there new materialized views or indexes** that the optimizer might be choosing badly?
* **Is the warehouse the same size?** A teammate accidentally downsized the Snowflake warehouse.
* **Are you actually reading the same table?** A view definition changed, or a search path changed.

### Prevention

Three habits help:

1. **Tag and time critical queries.** A daily job that times itself and alerts on >2x slowdown catches this on day one.
2. **Periodic `ANALYZE`** on growing tables. Most warehouses do this automatically, but some configurations require it.
3. **Pin the plan when it really matters.** Some engines support plan hints (BigQuery has limited hints; Postgres has `pg_hint_plan`). For a critical job, locking the plan removes the surprise.

### Common mistakes interviewers want you to name

1. **Reaching for more compute first.** Wastes money and time.
2. **Not capturing the plan when it was fast.** Then you cannot compare.
3. **Skipping ANALYZE / statistics update.** Often the cure.
4. **Blaming the database.** Usually the data changed.
5. **Not setting up alerting on query duration.** This incident should have been caught at 1 minute, not 40.

### Bonus follow-up the interviewer might throw

> *"What if the data didn't change either? Same query, same data, suddenly 80x slower."*

Then the cause is environmental. Likely:

* Warehouse downsized.
* Heavy concurrent workload from another team or job.
* A new query has poisoned the result cache and is forcing recomputation.
* Storage backend issue (rare but real).

Check the warehouse load metrics for that timestamp and see if there's a spike of concurrent jobs. If yes, the problem is contention, not the query.
